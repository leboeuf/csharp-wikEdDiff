# csharp-wikEdDiff

csharp-wikEdDiff is a C# (.NET Standard 2.0) port of the WikEdDiff JavaScript library.

WikEdDiff is a visual inline-style difference engine with block move support.

The original wikEdDiff library returns html/css-formatted text with highlighted deletions, insertions, and block moves. It can be found here:

- MediaWiki extension: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:wikEdDiff

There were no changes to the algorithm, so all credits go to the original author, Cacycle.
